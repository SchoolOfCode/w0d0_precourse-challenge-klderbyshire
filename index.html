    <h2>BONDI TO COOGEE WALK</h2>
    <p>This 6km walk will take around two to three hours depending on how often you stop. You can make this into a full day activity by taking a dip in many of the outdoor pools that you pass enroute. Spectacular ocean views, white beaches and rock pools await and is a must-do activity when in Sydney. You may even spot the resident whales and dolphins at the right time of year!</p>
